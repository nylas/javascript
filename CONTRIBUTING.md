- **Integration tests** for complex workflows
- **High coverage** to ensure reliability

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter @nylas/connect test
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files next to the code they test (`.test.ts` suffix)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## üìù Style Guide

### Code Style

- **ESM only** - No CommonJS support
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed code
- **Modern JavaScript** - Use latest ES features
- **Functional programming** - Prefer pure functions when possible
